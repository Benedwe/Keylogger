# Keylogger.py

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a simple keylogger in Python. A keylogger is a program designed to capture and log all keystrokes made on a keyboard. This project is intended for educational purposes only to help beginners learn about Python programming and how such tools work.

## Features

- Captures and logs all keystrokes on the keyboard.
- Saves the recorded keystrokes to a file for review.
- Lightweight and easy to understand for beginners.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as VS Code or PyCharm.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Benedwe/Keylogger.py.git
   cd Keylogger.py
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary library manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. Run the keylogger script:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

## Output

The keylogger will log all keystrokes to a file named `log.txt`. This file will be created in the same directory as the script.

## Important Notes

- **Ethical Use**: This project is for **educational purposes only**. Do not use this software on any computer without the explicit permission of the owner. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.
- **Disclaimer**: The author does not take responsibility for any misuse of this tool.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events.
2. Each keystroke is captured and saved into a log file.
3. The log file (`log.txt`) contains the recorded keystrokes for review.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will learn:

- How to use Python to interact with system hardware like the keyboard.
- Basics of Python libraries such as `pynput`.
- File handling in Python to save and read data.
